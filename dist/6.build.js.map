The summer of 2015, I traveled through Montana where I met a fellow who makes knives. Ben Quilling is a fourth generation Montana logger who spiked my interest in knife making. He welcomed me into his home, fed me dinner and introduced me to his family. Later that evening Ben showed me his hand built cabin which he uses as a knife making shop. After baffling me with his knives, tools and shiny things he said “Well, what are you doin tomorrow? Come by in the morning and we’ll make you a knife.” I showed up the next morning, twelve hours of work and 2 cases of beer later, I had my first handmade knife.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I had to leave Montana the next morning to start my Fall senior term at Oregon State University. Well, you sure bet I took the love of grinding steel with me. Scrounged up some spare money and bought the bare tools needed to start knife grinding. All through my senior year of college, I worked on knives in my garage. I gave the first few away to family and friends and got a few $20 and $50 dollar bills from others who wanted some. After putting the time in and working through major flaws, I have honed in on a gorgeous product.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I graduated from Oregon State University in the spring of 2016 and adventure was in my bones. I loaded up my tools, workbench, dirtbike and pup into my truck for another summer adventure. I headed back out to Montana where I visited Ben to show him that his one day of knife making put the itch in my bones. After a whole winter of hashing out knife flaws and figuring out little details, I got to spend two weeks working with my teacher.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              After my trip over the summer I decided to take the knives for a more permanent rout. I bought a full sized Blue Bird school bus from the Ashland School district in Oregon and converted it into my knife workshop and store front. The back half of the bus is my work shop and the front half is a more inviting area for customers to look at finished knives on display. I decided to convert a mobile shop because it is an easy way for me to own my business without having to dive too deep into debt by having to rent shop space as well as store front space. I can move this shop to whatever home I move into or whatever land I end up buying.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              So keep an eye out! You may see a wandering knife making schoolbus driving around one day and I’ll be inside!!\n            </p> -->\n\n        <p>\n\n          Making knives is all about putting a beautiful usable tool into the hands of someone who would love to own one. I make knives that can be used for almost any purpose. Keeping my knives practical and usable is a large part of my goal as a knife maker. Go out into the field and gut an elk, wear your knife on your side daily or just keep it around to slice some cheese. Everybody has a different reason to own a handmade tool.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n          I am an Oregon based knife maker who has been making knives for two years. In the fall of 2016 I bought a full size school bus and converted it out into my knife shop. This was my way to take the next step into my journey of knife making. In a way, it gave me an opportunity to build my own home and tool shop. Building out this bus was a large project and I will never regret doing it. Wood stove burning in the winter and windows open in the summer.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n          Come on into the bus and design a custom knife with me or find one that i’ve already made to fit your hand. Each blade is shaped, beveled and balanced by hand. The handles are shaped and hand sanded. Each knife is fitted with a custom hand stitched sheath that will only fit that specific blade. No two knives are the same. My goal as a knife maker is to put a beautiful usable tool into your hand. Nothing makes me happier than to see an old knife that I made earn its patina over time. Put these knives to work and bring them back to me for a resharpening or any odd maintenance that you might need.\n\n        </p>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nvar desktop = require(\"../../assets/busFront.jpg\");\nvar mobile = require(\"../../assets/busFront.jpg\");\n</script>\n<style scoped lang=\"scss\">\n.flex-container {\n  @media (min-width: 769px) {\n    margin: 2rem 0;\n  }\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: column wrap;\n}\n\np {\n  margin: 0 auto 2rem;\n  line-height: 1.75; //font-size: 1.35rem;\n  max-width: 50rem;\n}\n\n#story {\n  padding-bottom: 4rem;\n}\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/sections/Story.vue","exports = module.exports = require(\"../../../node_modules/css-loader/lib/css-base.js\")(false);\n// imports\n\n\n// module\nexports.push([module.id, \".flex-container[data-v-f7ed4b56]{display:flex;flex-flow:column wrap}@media (min-width:769px){.flex-container[data-v-f7ed4b56]{margin:2rem 0}}p[data-v-f7ed4b56]{margin:0 auto 2rem;line-height:1.75;max-width:50rem}#story[data-v-f7ed4b56]{padding-bottom:4rem}\", \"\"]);\n\n// exports\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/css-loader!./~/vue-loader/lib/style-compiler?{\"vue\":true,\"id\":\"data-v-f7ed4b56\",\"scoped\":true,\"hasInlineConfig\":false}!./~/sass-loader/lib/loader.js!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=styles&index=0!./src/components/sections/Story.vue\n// module id = 492\n// module chunks = 5 6","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"roo.jpg?a1a8ba325689c262c2b5b0690c181567\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/assets/roo.jpg\n// module id = 493\n// module chunks = 5 6","function injectStyle (ssrContext) {\n  require(\"!!vue-style-loader!css-loader!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/style-compiler/index?{\\\"vue\\\":true,\\\"id\\\":\\\"data-v-f7ed4b56\\\",\\\"scoped\\\":true,\\\"hasInlineConfig\\\":false}!sass-loader!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/selector?type=styles&index=0!./Story.vue\")\n}\nvar normalizeComponent = require(\"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/component-normalizer\")\n/* script */\nexport * from \"!!babel-loader!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/selector?type=script&index=0!./Story.vue\"\nimport __vue_script__ from \"!!babel-loader!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/selector?type=script&index=0!./Story.vue\"\n/* template */\nimport __vue_template__ from \"!!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler/index?{\\\"id\\\":\\\"data-v-f7ed4b56\\\",\\\"hasScoped\\\":true,\\\"buble\\\":{\\\"transforms\\\":{}}}!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/selector?type=template&index=0!./Story.vue\"\n/* template functional */\nvar __vue_template_functional__ = false\n/* styles */\nvar __vue_styles__ = injectStyle\n/* scopeId */\nvar __vue_scopeId__ = \"data-v-f7ed4b56\"\n/* moduleIdentifier (server only) */\nvar __vue_module_identifier__ = null\nvar Component = normalizeComponent(\n  __vue_script__,\n  __vue_template__,\n  __vue_template_functional__,\n  __vue_styles__,\n  __vue_scopeId__,\n  __vue_module_identifier__\n)\n\nexport default Component.exports\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/components/sections/Story.vue\n// module id = 494\n// module chunks = 5 6","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col flex-container\"},[_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n\\n        Making knives is all about putting a beautiful usable tool into the hands of someone who would love to own one.
