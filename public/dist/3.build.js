The summer of 2015, I traveled through Montana where I met a fellow who makes knives. Ben Quilling is a fourth generation Montana logger who spiked my interest in knife making.\n        He welcomed me into his home, fed me dinner and introduced me to his family. Later that evening Ben showed me his hand built cabin which he uses as a knife making shop. After baffling me with his knives, tools and shiny things he said “Well, what\n        are you doin tomorrow? Come by in the morning and we’ll make you a knife.” I showed up the next morning, twelve hours of work and 2 cases of beer later, I had my first handmade knife.\n      ")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("\n        I had to leave Montana the next morning to start my Fall senior term at Oregon State University.

All\n        through my senior year of college, I worked on knives in my garage. I gave the first few away to family and friends and got a few $20 and $50 dollar bills from others who wanted some.
